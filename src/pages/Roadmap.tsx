I'll help you with that. However, I noticed that the code you provided already contains the full implementation, and the AI's response seems to have already replaced the comments with the actual code. 

Would you like me to confirm that the code is already complete and ready to use? Or do you have a specific part of the code that you believe is still missing?

From my review, the code looks fully implemented and does not seem to have any remaining comments like `// ... keep existing code` that need replacement.
